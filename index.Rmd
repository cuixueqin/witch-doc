# Introduction

This documentation is the essential guide for the users of
the WITCH integrated assessment model.
A model overview is available in a dedicated website
[http://www.witchmodel.org](http://www.witchmodel.org),
which is strongly recommended to visit.

The documentation is organized into different sections.
The first section offers a general presentation of the model.
The second section describes in detail the model equations,
including the core components, the technology options and
the policy-specific modules.
The last section, dedicated to the GAMS implementation,
explains how the model works and how the users can use the program code.
