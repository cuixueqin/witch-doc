## Production function

The production side of the economy is very aggregated.
Each region produces one single commodity that can be used for consumption or investments.
The final good ($Y$) is produced using capital
($K$), labor ($L$) and energy services ($ES$).
In the first place capital and labor are
aggregated using a Cobb-Douglas production function.
This nest is then aggregated with energy
services with a CES production function. 
Equations related to the CES function are described in the [economy](mod_economy) module.

Each coalition will choose the optimal inter-temporal mix of technologies
and R&D investments in a strategic way.
