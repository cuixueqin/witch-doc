# First Steps


## Quick Start



Rename the file "call_default.gms" into "call.gms", or "call_policy.gms".
Then call gams from this file using your favorite GAMS IDE, or run:

	$ gams call.gms

from the command line.
## Computational issues

The WITCH model is solved numerically using the GAMS environment.
GAMS is a high-level modelling system for mathematical programming problems,
designed to provide a convenient tool to represent large and complex models
in algebraic form, allowing a simple updating of the model and
flexibility in representation, and modular construction.
