## Research and Development

One of the main features of the WITCH model is the characterisation
of endogenous technical change.
Albeit difficult to model, technological innovation is key to
the decoupling of economic activity from environmental degradation,
and the ability to induce it using appropriate policy
instruments is essential for a successful climate agreement,
as highlighted also in the Bali Action Plan. 

Both innovation and diffusion processes are modelled.
We distinguish dedicated R&D investments for enhancing energy efficiency
from investments aimed at facilitating the competitiveness of
innovative low carbon technologies (backstops) in both the electric
and non-electric sectors.
The returns to R&D investment depend on the stock of previously accumulated knowledge.
Higher knowledge stock facilitates generation of new, energy saving innovations.
In addition, international spillovers of knowledge are
accounted for to mimic the flow of ideas and knowledge across
countries. 

### Knowledge stock for energy efficiency

[Eq. **eqk_rd_en**]
The stock of knowledge evolves according to the perpetual rule.

$$
    HE(n,t+1) = HE(n,t) (1-\delta_{RD})^{\Delta_{t}} + 
                \Delta_{t} a I_{RD}^b \times HE(n,t)^c \times SPILL(t,n)^d
$$

At each point in time, new ideas are produced using a Cobb-Douglas combination
between domestic investments, $I_{RD}$, the existing stock of knowledge,
$HE$ and the knowledge of other countries, $SPILL$.

The contribution of foreign knowledge to the production of new domestic ideas
depends on the interaction between two terms: the first describes the 
absorptive capacity whereas the second captures the distance from the
technology frontier, which is represented by the stock of knowledge
in OECD countries (USA, OLDEURO, NEWEURO, CAJANZ and KOSAU).

[Eq. **eqspill_coop**]
Cooperation :
internalises the externalities due the spillovers (but only optimises over the regions inside the coalition)

$$
    SPILL(t,n) = \frac{HE(t,n)}{\sum_{n\in \text{OECD}} HE(t,n)} \times
                 \left(
                 \sum_{n\in \text{OECD}} HE(t,n) - HE(t,n)
                 \right)
$$

The knowledge stock dedicated for energy efficiency is combined with energy supply and autonomous energy efficiency improvement to form energy services. Energy services are then used as an input in production of final good (see equations [Eq. **eqq_y**] and [Eq. **eqq_fen_**])

### Knowledge stock in backstop technologies

RD stock accumulates with the perpetual rule and with the contribution of
international knowledge spillovers, $SPILL$

$$
    RD_{j}(n,t+1) = RD_{j}(n,t) (1-\delta_{RD})^{\Delta_{t}} + 
                \Delta_{t} I_{RD}^b \times SPILL_{j}(t,n)^d
$$

The spillovers in backstop technologies are determined analogously to spillovers in energy efficiency related knowledge:


$$
    SPILL_{j}(t,n) = \frac{RD_{j}(n,t)}{\sum_{n\in \text{OECD}} RD_{j}(n,t)} \times
                 \left(
                 \sum_{n\in \text{OECD}} RD_{j}(n,t) - RD_{j}(n,t)
                 \right)
$$

The knowledge stock in backstop technologies is used to lower installation costs, $SC$. The installation costs are determined by a two factor learning curve: 1 percent drop in installation costs can be achieved upon $\frac{1}{lbr\_rate}$% increase in backstop technology knowledge stock (//learning by searching//) or $\frac{1}{lbr\_rate}$% increase in stock of experience in utilising the technology (following the *learning by doing* principle). The stock of experience is proxied with total installed capacity in the world (equation [Eq. **eqmcost_inv_back_lbd**]).

### Two Factor Learning Curve

We predict the future costs of the backstop technologies, $SC$ using the Two Factor Learning Curve (e.g. Klaassen et al., 2005 and SÃ¶derholm and Sundqvist, 2007). The costs can decrease as a result of accumulation of experience (learning by doing) or investment in research and development (learning by searching). In our model, the stock of experience is proxied with world cumulated installed capacity, $wcum$. The accumulation of R&D knowledge stock is described in the section above. The two factor learning curve takes the form

$$
\frac{SC_{j}(t,n)}{SC_{j}(0,n)} = \left( \frac{RD_{j}(t,n)}{RD_{j}(0,n)} \right)^{lbrrate} \left( \frac{wcum_{j}(t,n)}{wcum_{j}(0,n)} \right)^{lbdrate} 
$$

where $lbr\_rate$ and $lbd\_rate$ are learning by doing and learning by searching parameters respecitvely.


### Innovations

$$
\frac{PAT(t,n)}{pat0(n)} = \left(\frac{K_{PAT}(t,n)}{kpat0(n)}\right)^{\beta_{spill domestic}}
\left(\frac{\sum_{n\in \text{OECD}} K_{PAT}(t,n)}{\sum_{n\in \text{OECD}} kpat0(n)}\right)^{\beta_{spill int}}
\left(\frac{ESC_{PAT}(t,n)}{ESC_{PAT}(0,n)}\right)^{\beta_{enexp}}
$$

growth for the frontier countries:
$$
\frac{A_{ENTECH}(t+1,n)}{A_{ENTECH}(t,n)} =  \left(\frac{Y(t+1,n)}{Y(t,n)}\right) ^{\beta_{y}} *\left(1+const_{eneff}+tstep*\beta_{enrd}*\sum_{n\in \text{OECD}} PAT(t,n) \right)
$$

$$
1+\frac{1-\rho}{\rho}enintg0 - \frac{1}{\rho}*peng0 = 1+ \beta_{y}*gdpg0+  const_{eneff}+tstep*\beta_{enrd}*\sum_{n\in \text{OECD}} pat0(n)
$$

$$
1+\frac{1-\rho}{\rho}enintg0 - \frac{1}{\rho}*peng0 = 1+ \beta_{y}*gdpg0+  const_{eneff}+tstep*\beta_{enrd}*\sum_{n\in \text{OECD}} pat0(n)
$$

growth for the developing countries:

$$
RBENIM(t,n)=\left(\frac{ENINT(t,n)}{ENINT(t,'usa')}\right)^{\frac{1-\rho}{-\rho}}*\left(\frac{GDPPC(t,n)}{GDPPC(t,'usa')}\right)^{\beta_{y}}
$$

$$
\frac{A_{ENTECH}(t+1,n)}{A_{ENTECH}(t,n)} =  const*IMINNSWITCH(t,n)*\left(\frac{GDPPC(t,n)}{GDPPC(t,'usa')}\right)^{\beta_{yim}}
$$
$$
IM(t,n)=\left(\frac{RBENIM(t,n)}{RBENIM('1',n)}\right) ^{\beta_{conv}}
$$
$$
IN(t,n)=1+tstep*\beta_{enrd}*\sum_{n} PAT(t,n)
$$
