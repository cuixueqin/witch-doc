## Carbon capture and storage (CCS)

This module introduces the Carbon Capture and Storage (**CCS**) in the model.

For CCS, supply costs of injection and sequestration reflect sitesâ€™
availability at the regional level,
as well as energy penalty, capture and leakage rates.

IGCC with CCS competes with traditional coal which is replaced for
a sufficiently high carbon price signal.
For nuclear power, waste management costs are also modeled,
but no exogenous constraint is assumed.
Hydroelectric power is assumed to evolve exogenously to reflect
limited site availability. 

### Emission storage

$$
    Q_{CCS} = \sum_{f,j} Q_{f,j}(t,n) \times ccs\_capture\_rate_f
$$

$$
    M_{CCS}(t,n) = \sum_{t'<t} \Delta_{t'} \times Q_{CCS}(t',n)
$$


### Emission cost

CCS transport and storage is function of the cumulative sequestrated emissions. 

$$
    C_{CCS}(n,t) = a_{CCS}(n) e^{\alpha_{CCS}(n) \times M_{CCS}(t,n)^{\beta_{CCS}(n)}}
$$
