# Fossil fuel prices

The fossil fuel module allows for different assumptions of resource availability and fuel prices regarding oil, gas and coal.
These assumptions were derived from the ROSE project (http://www.rose-project.org/). 


*  L = Low fossil fuel availability (implies higher price of fuel)  

*  M = Medium fossil fuel availability

*  H = High fossil fuel availability (implies lower price of fuel)
